Series of codes created to optimize the analysis of the FAR3d outputs.

Automatization Folder: Contains the scripts to create the folders with the Input characteristics the user wish to study and launch FAR3d simulations in a much faster way. It was develop to use it in the cluster URANUS in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

Rotational Transform Couplings: It gives the toroidal couplings with the relevant poloidal couplings, and iota profile. The outputs for couplings are represented in two graphs and an excel with all relevant values. As inputs, it receives the profile.dat file from FAR3d and the periods for the device.
